    Hi 👋, I’m <strong>Rohit Kumar</strong>.

    This blogging website is my space to share thoughts, experiences, and learnings around
    programming, web development, and technology.

    I enjoy building full-stack applications, experimenting with new tools,
    and continuously improving my skills. I believe in writing clean,
    maintainable code and learning something new every day.
  </p>

  <p>
    Through this platform, I aim to document my journey, share useful insights,
    and connect with like-minded developers.
